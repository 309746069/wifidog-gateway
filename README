The WiFi Guard Dog project will be a complete and embedable captive portal
solution for wireless community groups or individuals who wish to open a
free HotSpot while still preventing abuse of their Internet connection.

The project maintains a Wiki at http://ilesansfil.org/wiki/WiFiDog
and a mailing list which can be found here:
http://isf.waglo.com/mailman/listinfo/wifidog_isf.waglo.com

Note that the mailing list interface is in french and that there's a drop
down menu to choose the language on the right hand side. "Visualiser en"
translates to "View in" and "Francais" is french for French while
"Anglais (E-U)" stands for "English (US)."

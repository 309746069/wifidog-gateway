	* doc/doxygen.cfg.in:  Config tweaking.  Exclude libhttpd directory, enable todolist and buglist
	* src/common.h:  Include the autoconf config.h.  Add a todo to state that this file is evil.
	* src/userclasses.h:  As requested, document a file to show how doxygen works.  Check out what happens with the todo in "Related Pages" in the docs.  You all installed doxygen, right?

	* Properly integrate libhttpd into the source tree ;)  Note that this will create a proper system wide shared librery for libghttpd.  Still to be done:  1- Store Mina's patch somewhere,  in case we want to upgrade libhttpd.  2-Add configure option not to build httpd, and use an already installed one.

2004-04-18  Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@acv.ca>
	* Fixed pthread_cond_timedwait. The mutex needed to be locked as
	per the POSIX spec, yet Linux or Mac OS X don't care...
	* Fixed the double SIGTERM handler on Linux...

2004-04-17  Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@acv.ca>
	* Added work around for uClibc bug in auth.c

2004-04-17  Philippe April <papril777@yahoo.com>
	* Fixed firewall scripts to make them standard and some firewall functions

2004-04-17  Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@acv.ca>
	* Updated documentation in firewall.c

2004-04-17  Philippe April <papril777@yahoo.com>
	* Fixed path returning to gateway in phpauth/login/index.php

2004-04-16  Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@acv.ca>
	* Merged in libhttpd into the source tree

2004-04-16  Philippe April <papril777@yahoo.com>
	* Fixed CRLF/formatting in phpauth/login/index.php

	* Removed an unnecessary line dist_sysconf_DATA from Makefile.am

2004-04-15  Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@acv.ca>
	* Changed the locking mechanism, now all access to t_node * structs
	are properly protected.

2004-04-15  Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@acv.ca>
	* Connection now closed if counter hasn't change for one full
	period.

	* Existing IPs are logged off when they're authenticated again.

2004-04-14  Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@acv.ca>
	* Fixed clean up so it happens at the right time.

2004-04-14  Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@acv.ca>
	* Major retooling of insert_userclass(), fixed seg fault.
	* The program now works as advertised.

2004-04-14  Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@acv.ca>
	* Switched to threads. Alpha quality build, at best

2004-04-12  Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@acv.ca>
	* Changed child return value handling, again. Now it's actually
	using the real value instead of the flag.
	* The http.c authentication code now closes the http connection
	from the user.

2004-04-11  Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@acv.ca>

	* SIGCHLD Handler initializaed outside of deamon mode now.

2004-04-11  Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@acv.ca>
	* Very large modification. The entire architecture has been reworked
	so that authentications to the central server are performed in a
	fork()'d child process and the exit code from that child is then
	used to set the User Class of the connection.
	* The UserClasses (global definitions) and Rights (per connection)
	have been integrated.

2004-03-16  Mina Naguib <minaguib@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Changed HTTP server tasks to be handled by libhttpd - merged
	incorporate_libhttpd branch

2004-03-13  Philippe April <papril777@yahoo.com>
	* Modified the way firewall scripts are called so we can configure
	them in the config file (a bit more modular than it was)
	* Added simple linked list to keep track of clients and to
	keep a counter of the utilization and send it to the auth server
	* Fixed CRLF/formatting in phpauth/auth/index.php
	* Hacked phpauth/auth/index.php to handle very basic utilization tracking

2004-03-12  Philippe April <papril777@yahoo.com>
	* Changed all perror()s into debug()s and added errno.h to common.h

2004-03-10  Philippe April <papril777@yahoo.com>
	* Small fix to firewall.c so we don't define variables after
	the function has started (so it builds on gcc-2.95)

2004-03-09  Philippe April <papril777@yahoo.com>
	* Major changes, not forking anymore for new connections, now using
	select() instead. It will allow us to efficiently use a linked list to track
	users and other things. It introduces some bugs and design issues but will
	be better in the end.

2004-03-09  Philippe April <papril777@yahoo.com>
	* Small fix in the default.php login page
	* exit() where the program was supposed to exit but wasn't when the
	firewall could not be setup

2004-03-09  Alexandre Carmel-Veilleux <acv@acv.ca>
	* Tiny change to increase cross-platform compatibility. It can now build on OS X and it comes close to building on my old BSD box.

2004-03-08  Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* Initial CVS import.  Integrate a standrad GNU build system and Doxygen to the build process.  Add Doxygen and CVS headers, .cvsignores, etc.  Note that the imported code is Philippe April (papril777 at yahoo.com)'s work.  Tell me if I forgot anything.  Please note that the paths in the src/fw* scripts are still hardcoded.  Don't forget to update the ChangeLog file every commit and add doxygen comments to your code.  Happy hacking.

WiFiDog 1.1.0_beta3:
	- Completely re-did the iptables rules.  Most of the rules are now in the
	filter table instead of the nat table.  Also DROPs are now replaced with
	REJECTs to help tell the user connection refused instead of endless pauses
    - wdctl status will return more informations
    - Some error messages are now displayed by the auth server (used to
    be done in a non-pretty way by wifidog)
    - We now 'ping' authserver and detect when authservers are changing IPs
    - Fixed memory leaks
    - Incoming and outgoing counters were reversed
    - More verbose debugging
	- ICMP Ping the users everytime we check their counters to keep them alive
	- Optional ExternalInterface
	- Optional GatewayAddress
	- /about URL now shows wifidog version
	- Keep track of last times we successfully & unsuccessfully spoke to the
	auth server/used DNS. Then, if we know we're not online, show a little
	apology to the user instead of re-directing them to the auth server.
	- When pinging auth server now also sends sys_uptime, sys_memfree
	and sys_load
	- Bugfix: Traffic from client to router was counted twice in the "outgoing"
	bytecount since it increased both counters in mangle.* and filter.* - Got
	rid of TABLE_WIFIDOG_WIFI_TO_GW completely since it's unneeded
	- Do not update the last_updated field on incoming traffic - update it on
	outgoing traffic only.  This should be a much more reliable indication of
	client no longer being there
	- WiFiDog status is now viewable with a web browser at
	http://ip:port/wifidog/status

WiFiDog 1.0.2:
	- Fix reversed incoming and outgoing connections in statistics reported to the auth server
	- Will now gracefully handle auth servers changing IP adress.
	- Fixes two bugs in byte counting. (Possible missed data, and incoming and outgoing were reversed.
	- Fixed file descriptor leaks
	- wdctl_status now returns all connected	users.
	- worked around sed -i not being available on all platform
	- ipkg no longuer overwrites config file
	- Several code changes in thread handling and libhttpd to fix occasional hangs.

WiFiDog 1.0.0:
	- Initial release
